# Frog Boy Color
The Frog Boy Color is a reimagining of the Nintendo Game Boy Color, aka the greatest Game Boy ever made. Taking the best parts of a modded GBC -- large screen with correct aspect ratio, no cartridges sticking out, etc -- and marrying them to a horizontal format ala the GBA, the Frog Boy is the realization of exactly the kind of Game Boy I've wanted since I initially jumped into modding. 

Features include:
- All features of the original GBC minus IR -- use of GB/GBC cartridges, link cable, headphone jack, etc.
- Compatibie with popular laminated backlit screen kits from FunnyPlaying and others
- Stereo sound without headphones
- Internal battery rechargable via USB-C
- Tactile buttons like the GBA SP
- Two stage battery indicator

The following is a guide on how you can build your very own Frog Boy.

# Disclaimer/Warning/For the love of God, read this
The Frog Boy is not an easy project, nor is it a professional product, and as such there are some things to keep in mind as you consider building one.

Assembly of the Frog Boy requires intermediate-advanced skills in soldering and electronics tinkering, including:
- Desoldering/soldering of large ICs
- Desoldering of through hole parts
- Soldering of small surface mount devices
- Soldering of leadless ICs, for example the TSP61202
- Proficiency with a multimeter for troubleshooting and validation
This is in no way a project for beginners, and if you don't have experience with the above, I highly recommend starting smaller -- solder practice kits are cheap and easily available.

Along with needing the requisite skills, there is a very real possibility that you will irreparably damage either your donor Game Boy Color, or the resulting Frog Boy. Even the most skilled among us make mistakes, but it's important to keep in mind your own limits to avoid heartache and sorrow.

I am in no way a professional electrical engineer. All of my skills are self taught, or learned from other members of the modding community. While I have taken common sense measures to ensure that the Frog Boy is functional and safe, I can not guarantee that each and every decision made is correct. Build at your own discretion.

In summary, build at your own risk. I am not liable for any damage caused by your insatiable need to build a Game Boy named after an amphibian.

# Recommended Equipment
At a bare minimum, you should have:
- Temperature controlled soldering iron. I recommend the Pinecil as a great entry level option.
- Multimeter for troubleshooting. Any cheap digital multimeter from Amazon should do fine.
- Solder sucker for removing cartridge slot from donor GBC
- No clean flux

I highly recommend also having the following:
- A hot plate or hot air station for the QFN ICs, desoldering parts from GBC, etc
- Solder wick
